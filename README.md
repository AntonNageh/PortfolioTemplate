# Installation 
- Just type npm install after cloning the project so that all packages can be downladed and installed successfully.
# Please Note
- The project is not finished yet, I'm aiming to add some parallex effects and R3F for 3D objects.
- This Readme file is not even finished yet, I uploaded the code so I can deploy it on a Server.
